For Mozilla and Firefox the functionality of
"copy and Paste" are disabled by default. If you
wish your Typo3-User are able to use this, the User
must have the "user.js" with it contents in his
Mozilla Userdir. On Windows XP is this the following:

C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\
